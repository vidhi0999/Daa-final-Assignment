Final Project

📌 Topic: Fibonacci Heap — Advanced Priority Queue
📄 Project Report: Download DAA-Project.pdf

📌 Summary:
This project explores the Fibonacci Heap data structure, its implementation, and efficiency compared to Binary and Binomial heaps. It is widely used in Dijkstra’s and Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms due to its amortized O(1) decrease-key and insert operations.

🧪 Key Operations & Complexity

| Operation    | Amortized Time |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Insert       | O(1)           |
| Find-Min     | O(1)           |
| Decrease-Key | O(1)           |
| Extract-Min  | O(log n)       |
| Delete       | O(log n)       |
