### 📘 Summary
This project explores the **Fibonacci Heap** data structure, its implementation, and efficiency compared to **Binary** and **Binomial** heaps.  
It is widely used in **Dijkstra’s** and **Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree** algorithms due to its **O(1) amortized insert and decrease-key** operations.

### ⚙️ Key Operations & Time Complexity

| Operation     | Amortized Time |
|---------------|------------------|
| Insert        | O(1) |
| Find-Min      | O(1) |
| Decrease-Key  | O(1) |
| Extract-Min   | O(log n) |
| Delete        | O(log n) |
